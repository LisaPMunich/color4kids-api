# Full-Stack App "Color4Kids" (Nest, postgreSQL, Vue/React)

## Motivation
Since I wanted to utilise the advantages of building the server-side on a relational database, I built the backend for the coloring API using RESTful API with ExpressJS and PostgreSQL in May 2022. I never built the client-side to consume the endpoints served though.

Now I want to implement a full-stack app and this way further develop my skills as a full-stack web developer. That is why I want to build the backend and frontend from scratch - despite an existing backend. This is the tech I decided on:

#### Frontend
HTML, TypeScript, Vue.js or React, CSSTailwind
#### Backend
TypeScript, Nestjs, GraphQL, PostgreSQL


## Objective

The objective of this project is to build a full-stack app, which allows users to print out images from children movies for coloring. Therefore, the app displays a list of animated movies, which can be filtered by title or by specific key-words. The selected images can then be printed or downloaded.At a later stage a login will be added, so that authorized users can upload images.


## User Stories

As a user, I want to be able to see a list of children cartoons and filter them, so that I can find the ones I am interested in.

As a user, I want to see a list of pictures from one cartoon and filter them, so that I can choose which pictures I want to print.

As a user, I want to print out a picture directly or download it to my local device, so that I can color it.

As a user, I want the pictures I already printed out to be marked, so that I have an overview, which pictures I already printed or downloaded.


#### Bonus (later project stage)

As a user, I want to create a profile, so that I can save my favorite pictures to my profile and link to my favorite cartoons.

As a user, I want to mark a cartoon as my favorite, so that it appears at the top of the cartoon movie list.

As a user, I want to upload pictures I drew about certain children cartoons, so that they are added to the list of pictures.

## Features and Acceptance Criteria

The feature requirements below were extracted from the user stories listed above.
